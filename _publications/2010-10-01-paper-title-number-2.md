<p><strong>Exposures.</strong> Carbamazepine and other aromatic antiseizure medications.</p> 
<p><strong>Main Outcomes and Measures.</strong> All participants underwent whole genome sequencing. Putative genetic variants that modify the risk of developing carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN were identified using a machine-learning workflow.
